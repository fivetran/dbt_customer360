{# 
I am a Fivetran user who runâ€™s a SaaS company. I would like to send email campaigns to customers that fall into the following 3 segments: 

1. Customers who have more than 100k in yearly revenue and create more than 10 support tickets a year
2. Customers who have between 1k and 100k in yearly revenue and create more than 10 support tickets a year
3. Customers who have less than 1k in yearly revenue and create more than 10 support tickets a year
