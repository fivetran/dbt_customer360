{# 
Iâ€™m a Fivetran user who has a dashboard that shows me metrics on my customers (average order volume, total ARR, number of page visits, etc). These metrics are from a combination of sources. 

In this dashboard, I would like to be able to filter on any previous phone number the customer has had and find the specific customer.

In this dashboard, I would like to see the list of all the dimensions associated with the customer (email, phone, address, etc). This should include situations where a single customer 
has multiple of the same dimensions (ex: multiple phone numbers) 

Questions for elan: 
- should i only surface ALL phones, or other dimensions? currently thinking ALL phones, and then the most-confident/summary values (which are all individual-level) of other dimensions.
